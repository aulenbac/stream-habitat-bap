       "The survey design is explicitly stratified by state for both designs. The unequal probability categories are specific to the survey design used for the NRSA 2008/09, NRSA 2013/14, and NRSA 2018/19. In all cases the categories are specific combinations of Strahler order categories and nine National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) aggregated ecoregions. In addition, a minimum of 20 sites (Resample and New) was guaranteed in each state and a maximum of 75 sites was the limit for an individual state. There are 983 unique sites in the Resample Design and 825 unique sites in the New Site Design. Approximately 10% of the total NRSA sites are scheduled for repeated sampling (revisit sites) in the same year of the two year NRSA field cycle. The sample frame was derived from the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), in particular NHDPlus V2. Additional details on the NRSA survey design are found in the National Rivers and Streams Assessment Survey Design: 2018/19 documents.</td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

periods. This design is represented as a rotating panel that is serially augmented and alternates over a given period (Urquhart and others 1998). Initially, we will randomly select the subsample of reference and managed watersheds within the group. Our goal will be to select an even number of “reference” and “managed” watersheds for sampling. Because the number of “reference” watersheds is generally low, we will sample as many as possible within the group, up to half of the total number of watersheds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

In such a design, every element in the population has a known probability of being selected for sampling. This important feature ensures that the results of the survey reflect the full range in character and variation among flowing waters across the U.S. Site selection rules included weighting to provide balance in the number of river and stream sites from each of the size classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>Survey conducted in wadeable streams within the interior ColumbiaRiver basin on lands managed by U.S.orest Service (FS) Regions 1, 4, and 6 and the Idaho and Oregon/Washington State Offices of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

       "• New site design for NRSA 2018/19.\n",
       "The survey design is explicitly stratified by state for both designs. The unequal probability categories are specific to the survey design used for the NRSA 2008/09, NRSA 2013/14, and NRSA 2018/19. In all cases the categories are specific combinations of Strahler order categories and nine National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) aggregated ecoregions. In addition, a minimum of 20 sites (Resample and New) was guaranteed in each state and a maximum of 75 sites was the limit for an individual state. There are 983 unique sites in the Resample Design and 825 unique sites in the New Site Design. Approximately 10\\% of the total NRSA sites are scheduled for repeated sampling (revisit sites) in the same year of the two year NRSA field cycle. The sample frame was derived from the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), in particular NHDPlus V2.

This design is represented as a rotating panel that is serially augmented and alternates over a given period (Urquhart and others 1998). Initially, we will randomly select the subsample of reference and managed watersheds within the group. Our goal will be to select an even number of “reference” and “managed” watersheds for sampling. Because the number of “reference” watersheds is generally low, we will sample as many as possible within the group, up to half of the total number of watersheds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

Sampling locations are selected using a modern survey design approach called a probability-based sample design. In such a design, every element in the population has a known probability of being selected for sampling. This important feature ensures that the results of the survey reflect the full range in character and variation among flowing waters across the U.S. Site selection rules included weighting to provide balance in the number of river and stream sites from each of the size classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & Survey conducted in wadeable streams within the interior ColumbiaRiver basin on lands managed by U.S.orest Service (FS) Regions 1, 4, and 6 and the Idaho and Oregon/Washington State Offices of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

       "The survey design is explicitly stratified by state for both designs. The unequal probability categories are specific to the survey design used for the NRSA 2008/09, NRSA 2013/14, and NRSA 2018/19. In all cases the categories are specific combinations of Strahler order categories and nine National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) aggregated ecoregions. In addition, a minimum of 20 sites (Resample and New) was guaranteed in each state and a maximum of 75 sites was the limit for an individual state. There are 983 unique sites in the Resample Design and 825 unique sites in the New Site Design. Approximately 10% of the total NRSA sites are scheduled for repeated sampling (revisit sites) in the same year of the two year NRSA field cycle. The sample frame was derived from the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), in particular NHDPlus V2.

This design is represented as a rotating panel that is serially augmented and alternates over a given period (Urquhart and others 1998). Initially, we will randomly select the subsample of reference and managed watersheds within the group. Our goal will be to select an even number of “reference” and “managed” watersheds for sampling. Because the number of “reference” watersheds is generally low, we will sample as many as possible within the group, up to half of the total number of watersheds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

Sampling locations are selected using a modern survey design approach called a probability-based sample design. In such a design, every element in the population has a known probability of being selected for sampling. This important feature ensures that the results of the survey reflect the full range in character and variation among flowing waters across the U.S. Site selection rules included weighting to provide balance in the number of river and stream sites from each of the size classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Survey conducted in wadeable streams within the interior ColumbiaRiver basin on lands managed by U.S.orest Service (FS) Regions 1, 4, and 6 and the Idaho and Oregon/Washington State Offices of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

       "3  A collaborative survey that provides information on the ecological condition of the nation’s rivers and streams and the key stressors that affect them, both on a national and an ecoregional scale. \\nThe goals of the NRSA are to determine the extent to which rivers and streams support a healthy biological condition and the extent of major stressors that affect them. The survey supports a longer-term goal: to determine whether our rivers and streams are getting cleaner and how we might best invest in protecting and restoring them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "9  The survey design consists of two separate designs to address the dual objectives of: \\n(1)estimating current status and (2) estimating change in status for all flowing waters:\\n• Resample design applied to NRSA 2008/09 and NRSA 2013/14 sites.\\n• New site design for NRSA 2018/19.\\nThe survey design is explicitly stratified by state for both designs. The unequal probability categories are specific to the survey design used for the NRSA 2008/09, NRSA 2013/14, and NRSA 2018/19. In all cases the categories are specific combinations of Strahler order categories and nine National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) aggregated ecoregions. In addition, a minimum of 20 sites (Resample and New) was guaranteed in each state and a maximum of 75 sites was the limit for an individual state. There are 983 unique sites in the Resample Design and 825 unique sites in the New Site Design. Approximately 10% of the total NRSA sites are scheduled for repeated sampling (revisit sites) in the same year of the two year NRSA field cycle.

       "15 Survey conducted in wadable and bootable streams across the United States. Sampling locations are selected using a modern survey design approach called a probability-based sample design. In such a design, every element in the population has a known probability of being selected for sampling. This important feature ensures that the results of the survey reflect the full range in character and variation among flowing waters across the U.S. Site selection rules included weighting to provide balance in the number of river and stream sites from each of the size classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "11 We will then resample the same watersheds over subsequent 5-year periods. This design is represented as a rotating panel that is serially augmented and alternates over a given period (Urquhart and others 1998). Initially, we will randomly select the subsample of reference and managed watersheds within the group. Our goal will be to select an even number of “reference” and “managed” watersheds for sampling. Because the number of “reference” watersheds is generally low, we will sample as many as possible within the group, up to half of the total number of watersheds.\n",
